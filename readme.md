# rls

A Rust implementation of the classic Unix `ls` command.

## Project Overview

`rls` aims to recreate the functionality of the `ls` command using Rust. This project serves as a learning exercise.

> Note: This is a personal project and is not intended to replace the existing `ls` command, I am not that gifted.

## Features

The goal is to implement the following `ls` options:

- [x] `rls`: List all non-hidden files and directories in the current directory
- [ ] `rls -a`, `rls --all`: List all files and directories, including hidden ones
- [ ] `rls -A`, `rls --almost-all`: List all files and directories except `.` and `..`
- [ ] `rls -l`: Use long listing format
- [ ] `rls -h`, `rls --human-readable`: Print sizes in human-readable format (e.g., 1K, 234M, 2G)
- [ ] `rls -R`, `rls --recursive`: List subdirectories recursively
- [ ] `rls -d`, `rls --directory`: List directories themselves, not their contents
- [ ] `rls -r`, `rls --reverse`: Reverse order while sorting
- [ ] `rls -S`: Sort by file size, largest first
- [ ] `rls -t`: Sort by modification time, newest first
- [ ] `rls -X`: Sort alphabetically by entry extension
- [ ] `rls -1`: List one file per line
- [ ] `rls --color[=WHEN]`: Colorize the output; WHEN can be 'always', 'auto', or 'never'
- [ ] `rls -F`, `rls --classify`: Append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries
- [ ] `rls -i`, `rls --inode`: Print the index number of each file
- [ ] `rls -n`, `rls --numeric-uid-gid`: List numeric user and group IDs
- [ ] `rls -p`: Append / indicator to directories
- [ ] `rls -q`, `rls --hide-control-chars`: Print ? instead of non-graphic characters
- [ ] `rls --group-directories-first`: Group directories before files

## Roadmap

The following roadmap outlines the planned development stages for the `rls` project. Each step includes a status indicator to show the current progress:

- ðŸš€ In Progress, âœ… Completed, ðŸ”œ Planned, ðŸ”„ Under Review

1. âœ… Implement basic file listing functionality
2. ðŸš€ Add support for command-line arguments
3. ðŸ”œ Implement sorting options
4. ðŸ”œ Add support for different output formats
5. ðŸ”œ Implement advanced features (recursive listing, colorization, etc.)
6. ðŸ”œ Optimize performance
7. ðŸ”œ Add comprehensive error handling
8. ðŸ”œ Write unit and integration tests

The status of each step will be updated as the project progresses.
